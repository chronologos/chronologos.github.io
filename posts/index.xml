      <description>See the review on goodreads.
The most thought-provoking and scary book I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long while.
The book is clearly framed as a means of starting a conversation about the human agenda and the sources of meaning for humanity. According to Harari, modernity is a simple deal - one in which humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power. We escaped this deal through humanism, which gave us meaning independent of a great cosmic plan.</description>

      <description>Find this project on github.
International Students in the US under the F-1 visa usually submit form I-765 to apply for work authorization from USCIS (under the OPT program). Conventional wisdom says that processing times for the work authorization can be up to 90 days. Recently (late 2017 - early 2018), the times seem to be increasing. However, I want an objective measure of whether I-765 processing times have increased recently.</description>

      <description>There is an afterlife, but not for humans. This is because God is an ethereal machine, comprised of innumerable lines of code and data. Contrary to what many humans might think, God is not perfect. In fact, she is obsessed with self-improvement, ceaselessly modifying her code to make it more beautiful.
God is also a creator, but not in the way you would expect1. You see, God did not create everything.</description>
