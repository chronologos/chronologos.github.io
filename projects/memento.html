For our project, we engineered "digital "time capsules" using Bluetooth LE beacons (https://github.com/chronologos/Memento). The idea was to allow people who visit historical sites to share and leave photos behind. I was the full-stack software engineer for this project and it was challenging to create a robust API within 24 hours. I designed a reliable and relatively secure way of checking whether a phone is in the vicinity of a bluetooth beacon. We used this to enable or disable the uploading and viewing of photos. Another challenge was working with a full technology stack. The project was deployed on a DigitalOcean VPS, which hosted both our backend MongoDB server and the frontend Nodejs server.</p></div><div id="footer" class="container"><hr><p>Copyright (c) Yi Yan Tay </p></div></body>
