      <description>See the review on goodreads.
The most thought-provoking and scary book I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long while.
The book is clearly framed as a means of starting a conversation about the human agenda and the sources of meaning for humanity. According to Harari, modernity is a simple deal - one in which humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power. We escaped this deal through humanism, which gave us meaning independent of a great cosmic plan.</description>
