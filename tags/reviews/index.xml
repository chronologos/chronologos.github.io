      <description>I set an ambitious goal of reading a book a week in 2018. As of 27th December 2018, I am at 47&amp;frasl;52 (and not likely to get much further). Here are some thoughts about I learned during this journey:
 Finding a way to read consistently is key. I read everywhere this year - whether it was scrolling on my iPhone at bus stops, turning the pages of a physical book while at cafes or using the Kindle app on my iPad while lazing at home on a beanbag.</description>

      <description>See the review on goodreads.
The most thought-provoking and scary book I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long while.
The book is clearly framed as a means of starting a conversation about the human agenda and the sources of meaning for humanity. According to Harari, modernity is a simple deal - one in which humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power. We escaped this deal through humanism, which gave us meaning independent of a great cosmic plan.</description>
